	Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's late night programming block Adult Swim. The series follows the misadventures of Rick Sanchez, a cynical mad scientist, and his easily influenced grandson Morty, who split their time between domestic family life and interdimensional adventures.
<br>
<br>
The series has its origins in an animated parody of Back to the Future created by Roiland for film festival Channel 101. Adult Swim approached Harmon for television show ideas, and he and Roiland developed the program based on the short's two characters.
